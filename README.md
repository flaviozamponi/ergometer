# ergometer

Data from ergometer with single-stroke resolution can be obtained when a training unit is loaded to the online logbook. For example:  
https://log.concept2.com/profile/2599779/log/101767274  
In this case, by logging in (username flavio.zamponi) you have access to the raw data in the Section "Download Stroke Data"!

I use those data for this analysis.  

NB: there is no alternative: the usb stick attached to the rowing machine will not give you that granularity!
